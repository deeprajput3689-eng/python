# Image Name URL Generator (Flask – Python)

This is a simple Flask project that generates a URL for an image after uploading it.
The image can be accessed directly in the browser using the generated URL.

## How to Run the Project

1. Download and extract the project folder  
2. Open the folder in VS Code  
3. Install the required packages using:
   pip install -r requirements.txt  

4. Run the application:
   python app.py  

5. Once the server starts, open the browser and use the URLs to access images.

## Image Upload

- Images are stored in the `uploads` folder  
- Each image can be accessed using a unique URL  
- Example:
  http://127.0.0.1:5000/uploads/cat.jpg  

## 🎥 Project Demo Video
